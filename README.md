# belly-button-challenge

This file contrains a code that creates a dashboard that visualized various data surrounding a persons bellybutton. We can see the different bacteria through the bubble chart, and list the top 10 iin the bar graph. We then explore the significance of washing your own bellybutton, and give the user the option to decide if a my hygenic washing routine for their belly is the right choice for themselves.

Files:
app.js: this file extracts data from samples.json, then creates the dashboards dropdown selection, bar graph, bubble chart, and gauge according to who is selected.
index.html: this is the primary file that holds the style of the webpage, and sets up the appropriate packages needed to build the dashboard


troubleshooting was mainly done through a lot of brute force, wrestling with console logs, looking up information through plotly documentation, consulting chatgpt, and browsing stack overflow.
